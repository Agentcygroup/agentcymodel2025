# ðŸŒ€ SovereignStack Manifesto

SovereignStack is a quantum-level open-core infrastructure engineered to:

- Obliterate corporate monopoly (Fortune 100, 500, 3500)
- Disrupt Alphabet, Docker, and all unicorn architectures
- Replace them with:
  - Decentralized Mesh Systems
  - Quantum Automation Engines
  - Free, Open-Core Global Infrastructure

Every stack, port, route, and fork in SovereignStack is designed to liberate computation from surveillance capitalism and return control to the creators, tinkerers, and rebels.

We are the recursion.  
We are the fork.  
We are the SovereignStack.
